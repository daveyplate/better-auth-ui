## Localization Overview

You can fully customize the text strings displayed across all `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` components through the provided `localization` prop. The library ships with a full default localization object [`AuthLocalization`](/api-reference/auth-localization), but you can override any of these defaults easily with custom strings.

## Modifying Strings

To modify default strings, you need to provide your custom localization object within your `<AuthUIProvider>` or individual components.

Here's an example of modifying some default strings globally across your application using `<AuthUIProvider>`:

```tsx title="app/providers.tsx"
"use client"

import { AuthUIProvider } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"
import Link from "next/link"

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    const router = useRouter()

    return (
        <AuthUIProvider
            authClient={authClient}
            navigate={router.push}
            replace={router.replace}
            onSessionChange={() => router.refresh()}
            LinkComponent={Link}
            localization={{
                signIn: "Log in",
                signInDescription: "Use your email and password to log in.",
                signUp: "Create Account",
                forgotPassword: "Reset Password",
                emailPlaceholder: "your-email@example.com",
                passwordPlaceholder: "Secret password",
                magicLinkEmail: "Check your inbox for your login link!",
                forgotPasswordEmail: "Check your inbox for the password reset link.",
                resetPasswordSuccess: "You can now sign in with your new password!",
                changePasswordSuccess: "Your password has been successfully updated.",
                deleteAccountSuccess: "Your account has been permanently deleted.",
            }}
        >
            {children}
        </AuthUIProvider>
    )
}
```

## Customizing Strings Per Component

You can also provide overridden strings on an individual component basis. Here's how you can override strings for just one instance, such as the `<AuthCard>`:

```tsx
import { AuthCard } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"

export default function AuthPage({ params }: { params: { pathname: string } }) {
    return (
        <div className="flex justify-center items-center">
            <AuthCard
                pathname={params.pathname}
                localization={{
                    signIn: "Log In",
                    signUp: "Register an Account",
                    forgotPassword: "Forgot Your Password?",
                    signInDescription: "Log in and start using your account.",
                    magicLink: "Log in via Email",
                }}
            />
        </div>
    )
}
```

You can find all available strings to override in the [`AuthLocalization`](/api-reference/auth-localization) reference.
