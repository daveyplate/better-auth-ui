In order to use `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` with the [`@daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack`](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack) package, all you need to do is change your [`<AuthUIProvider>`](/components/auth-ui-provider) into an `<AuthUIProviderTanstack>` component. It accepts all of the same props and configuration options.

The main difference is the `persistClient` prop which is only required if you are using a [`persistQueryClient`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/plugins/persistQueryClient) for offline Authentication. This prop will tell the authentication methods to use the `/auth/callback` path for all authentication methods that leave the site, which will clear your query cache for you automatically.

```tsx title="app/providers.tsx"
"use client"

import { AuthUIProviderTanstack } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui/tanstack"
import Link from "next/link"
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"

import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <AuthUIProviderTanstack
      authClient={authClient}
      navigate={router.push}
      persistClient={false}
      replace={router.replace}
      onSessionChange={() => router.refresh()}
      LinkComponent={Link}
    >
      {children}
    </AuthUIProviderTanstack>
  )
}
```
